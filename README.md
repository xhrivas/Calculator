# 🧮 Calculator Program Functionality

This program performs basic arithmetic calculations with an option to continue using the previous result.

## 📌 Features
- Asks the user to **enter the first number**.
- Prompts for a **mathematical operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Requests the **second number**.
- Computes and displays the **result**.

## 🔁 Continuous Operation
- After calculation, the program asks:  
  👉 *"Do you want to continue with the previous result?"*  
- If **Yes** → Uses the previous result as the first number and repeats the process.  
- If **No** → Asks for a new first number and clears previous calculations.  

## 🎯 Example Workflow
1. Input: `5`  
2. Operator: `+`  
3. Input: `3`  
4. Output: `8`  
5. User chooses **Yes** → Next calculation starts with `8` as the first number.
